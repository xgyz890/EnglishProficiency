## The Phonetic System of English

I have been taking English speaking classes with native speakers, but I am **NOT** satisfied by my progress. 

My pronounciation just does not come to me as natural.

According to my observation, my speaking level is advanced, among all Chinese learners of English. I can be easily understood by native speakers (people that I talk to understand 80%~90% of what say) and my speech sounds fluent, but, I hit a bottle-net.

The way I pronouce words is unstable.

For words I am familar with, I pronounce them based on my intuition. For unfamilar words, I do not know how to approach them, so I try to copy their pronounciation by native speakers.  

Sometimes my pronouciation is perfect, but I do not even know how I do it; sometimes I am way off and cannot be understood.

This experience frustrates me.

As a PhD of engineering, I have been trying to find the hidden mechanism of pronounciation. 

I found Ann Cook's book, "The American Accent Training: Grammar" and followed it closely (mainly during the  quanrantine in early 2020). Thanks to the book, I improved my intonation and word connection, and got an overall Americanized jazz-like tone in my speech. I also tried shadowing speeches by native speakers, and my speaking skills were polished right after the excercises. However, that effect were quickly gone after I stopped practicing; my speech was often bumpy because of hesitation of words that I forgot how to pronounce, and my speech sound unnatural and forced when I try pronouncing the words intuitivly.

I remember thinking to myself, "it's ok, only the native speakers can sound really natural, because their organs of voicing have been shaped into the right form when the have been listening to and producing the voices in English everyday."

However, this blogger, Bella, blew my mind. As a Chinese, her pronounciation is as natural as a news anchor in VOA. She caught my attention immediately. Was she grow up in America? 

In another video, she said that she was born and raised in China, and received the same English education from public schools as every common Chinese student. She further explained that she trained herself how to speak English when she took English seriously in her undergrad.

I got overwhelmed the moment I heard this. 

What? No international schools, no expensive personal tutors, just by herself? How did she even do that!



#### What is a phonetic system anyway?
A phonetic notation system focuses on the **speech sound** of English. It describes the way we produce and preceive sounds in English, so it is a pronounciation visualizer.

It is one of four elements of the whole Phonetic System of English (other three ones are syllabic word structure, stress and intonation).

#### What is the phonetic notation system that I should learn?

The most famous term is **IPA** (International Phonetics Alphabet), which was devised by a group of linguistics in the late 19th century. 

IPA was designed for all human languages, not just for English. 

A linguistic named Daniel Jones borrowed a lot symbols from the original IPA for his system to represent the pronounciation of English (specifically, the Received Pronounciation, RP). His work, "The English Pronouncing Dictionary", has been regarded as the "IPA".

Later, Daniel Jones's phonetic system was coined as "DJ phonetics", or IPA63. A. C. Gimson, a student of Jones, modified IPA63 into IPA88, or the "Gimson phonetics". 

Although the DJ phonetic system and the Gimson phonetic system were designed for British English, they have no trouble representing pronounciation of American English. In fact, the Gimson system has been adopted by a dictionary which I currently use: Longman Advanced American Dictionary.

Meanwhile the Americans were working on their phonetics as well. A dictionary called "A Pronouncing Dictionary of American EnglishJohn" was published in 1944 by John Kenyon and Thomas Knott. As you see, this is a dictionary dedicated for the American English, and its phonetic system has been termed "KK", short for the lastnames of its authors. However, KK has not largely used in America, but in Taiwan, China instead.

So how do native speakers in America note the pronounciation of words? The answer is "respelling", which rewrites a word difficult to pronounce into a combination of words easy to pronouce. For instance, communication is noted by "kuh-MYOO-nuh-KAY-shun".

As an English user and learner who grew up in mainland China, I choose IPA88 to learn.

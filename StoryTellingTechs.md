## The Story Telling Techniques 

1. Make the story simplified, condense and punchier. Make it stronger.
2. Strengthen the image and action. Use sensory details: visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory.
3. Cut excessive pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions. 
4. Cut "thought verbs" (see C. Palahniuk's [writing advice](CPAdvice.md)).
5. Use literary devices.
6. Trust your audience. Do not overexplain.

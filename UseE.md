### Why are Chinese students not good at English even if they spend a lot time learning it? 

Because language can not be taught. The way you need to learn English is not using vocabulary or grammar books but focusing on real information, something you're interested in. Whatever you're interested in, use English as a tool to learn about it. You can't learn English from speaking. You can't learn English from textbooks.

You keep reading and listening every day. Those new words will appear time and time again. In the next article, the next one, the next one, everything will start to make sense and come together. Speaking is a byproduct, and speaking is a bonus.

Do you know why most of Japanese people can't speak English? The cause is not insufficient speaking practice but 99.99% of information Japanese people consume is Japanese, not English. They only read English textbooks. They don't consume interesting information in English, because in Japan, there is plenty of good quality information in Japanese. They almost translate everything. It's a huge market. Everything they like to read is translated, and also they produce knowledge, you know Nobel Prize winners. They also produce entertainment. Children learn from Japanese movies, games, anime. That's why Japanese kids watch Japanese anime, read Japanese manga. That's why they can't speak English.

The correct way people learn English is to learn other subjects in English at school. But in China, everything is in our native language. Vocabulary and grammar of English are not real knowledge. I'm not saying this is a problem. After all we have enough good quality information and our economy is huge. Without English we also live a good life. English speaking is not a marketable skill. The knowledge we have is marketable and valuable.
